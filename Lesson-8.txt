Class Based Components:
Earlier react has started with class based components.
Always while specifying the routes inside createBrowserRouter function do not use '/', since it takes the path as localhost:8908/...
While nesting of various paths just use the name of the paths.
=========================================
We cannot create a class based component without a render() method.
The render() method returns some JSX.
Content inside the constructor is only executed once - during the initial render.
Content inside the render method is executed once during initial render and each time the state variables change.
Constructor Call->render Call : IMP Flow
=========================================
We can make the componentDidMount() as async,but not the callback function inside the useEffect() hook.

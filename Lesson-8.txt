Class Based Components:
Earlier react has started with class based components.
Always while specifying the routes inside createBrowserRouter function do not use '/', since it takes the path as localhost:8908/...
While nesting of various paths just use the name of the paths.
=========================================
We cannot create a class based component without a render() method.
The render() method returns some JSX.
